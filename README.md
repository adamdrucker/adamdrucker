# Hello, I'm Adam. 
## I'm an intern doing some learning in Linux, and with Python. 
 Also, some more Python for my own interest during free time.

### I'm currently working on:
- [ ] ~Python Bottle project using PyCrypto and Fernet cryptography modules~ (partially completed, task ended)
- [ ] A number guessing game in Python, inspired by Final Fantasy XI's Abyssea treasure caskets
- [ ] A small Python module to convert integers to binary and binary to integer
- [ ] More mysterious cryptographic play with Python

### I'm currently learning:
* You guessed it...Python. It's been a great introductory language, and I'm looking forward to understanding how to use Python to solve problems
* I'm enrolled in Jose Portilla's Udemy course, which I'm hoping to finish soon, and have another Udemy Python course lined up (time permitting)

### I'm looking for help with:
* Any suggested learning resources to help me progress
* Any suggested edits to code in repositories I may have
* How I can be more Pythonic in my code
* Tips/advice for a Python/programming novice
