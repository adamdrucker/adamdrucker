# Hello, I'm Adam. 
## I'm a junior staff member with a sysadmin company doing learning in Linux with Bash, Python, Slurm, SaltStack. 

### I'm currently working on:
- [ ] A number guessing game in Python, inspired by Final Fantasy XI's Abyssea treasure caskets
- [ ] A small cryptolocking script that irreversibly encrypts certain file extensions
- [ ] A Slurm command wrapper script to get a formatted view of queue statistics

### I'm currently learning:
* More about Bash to automate tasks and make command wrappers
* Usage of Slurm in the HPC environment
