# Hello, I'm Adam. 
## I'm a junior staff member with a sysadmin company doing learning in Linux with Bash, Python, Slurm, SaltStack. 
 Also, some more Python for my own interest during free time.

### I'm currently working on:
- [ ] ~Python Bottle project using PyCrypto and Fernet cryptography modules~ (partially completed, task ended)
- [ ] A number guessing game in Python, inspired by Final Fantasy XI's Abyssea treasure caskets
- [ ] ~A small Python module to convert integers to binary and binary to integer~ (discontinued)
- [ ] A small cryptolocking script that irreversibly encrypts certain file extensions (for education, of course)

### I'm currently learning:
* Python...to understanding how to solve real-world problems
* Two Udemy Python courses (time permitting)
* SaltStack...to automate the installation of packages on different Linux distros

### I'm looking for help with:
* Any suggested learning resources to help me progress
* Any suggested edits to code in repositories I may have
* How I can be more Pythonic in my code
* Tips/advice for a Python/programming novice
